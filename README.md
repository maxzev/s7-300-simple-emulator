Emulator can correctly interconnects with TIAPortal. Emulator creates correct s7Comm packet that consists of header and data block.  Data blocks are the blocks that has been downloaded from real plc S7-300. For now only small part of the functionality is implemented: "Go online" connection with TIAPortal and  "Load from device" (to load blocks from device).
